Project Description

Informal "bro code" pacts lack accountability and permanence, leading to misunderstandings and broken promises. Current methods for documenting these agreements are outdated and don't capture their emotional significance. The challenge is to transform these pacts into lasting, secure, and emotionally resonant NFTs, creating a bridge between tradition and modernity.

Product Brief

We propose a platform that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and blockchain technology to turn "bro code" pacts into valuable, emotionally resonant Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). By generating clear and personalized pact text through LLMs, participants can make formal, legally sound commitments. These agreements are then securely stored on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust. The transformation of these pacts into NFTs adds emotional depth, permanence, and value to informal agreements, bridging the gap between tradition and modernity.
